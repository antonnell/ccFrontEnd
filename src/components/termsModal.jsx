              <b>Always backup your keys: </b>
              MyCrypto.com & MyCrypto CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an account or give us
              your funds to hold onto. No data leaves your computer / your browser. We make it easy for
              you to create, save, and access your information and interact with the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>We are not responsible for any loss: </b>
              Ethereum, MyCrypto.com & MyCrypto CX, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use
              are under active development. While we have thoroughly tested & tens of thousands of wallets
              have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the possibility
              something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be lost. Please do not invest more
              than you are willing to lose, and please be careful.
            </p>
